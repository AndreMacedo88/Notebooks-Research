# Purpose
This module intent is to build "by hand" many types of deep learning algorithms.

# Get datasets
To test the algorithms we need data. Here are some resources to know where to get the data:

## Sklearn
### Toy

### Real world
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html
### Generated

## PyTorch
https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html
